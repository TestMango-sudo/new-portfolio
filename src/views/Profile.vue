        <h1>Profile Page</h1>
        <p>Over the last year or so I have been diving into re-skilling with Python, JavaScript, HTML5, CSS 3. <br>
          To Aid this learning I have completed two short courses with Hyperion Dev and Northcoders as follows:. <br>
          NorthCoders Javascript Software Development Bootcamp: This was a three month course mainly focused around JavaScript and it's frameworks and libraries, 
          culminating with the building of a three part full stack project and final full stack application built with a team of five others devs. 
          I have continued to work with the team on this project and we are currently in the process of adding new features and improving the application we built together.<br>
          Partner Programming and working in teams of other coders was part of the course from very early on.
          <br>
          Hyperion Dev Python Software Development: This was a 10 week course focussing on solidifying the basics of Python and it's libraries. 5 projects were completed during this course including a CRUD application using SQL Lite 3.
          <br>During these courses I have gotten to grips with various concepts of software development such as OOP, test-driven development and the sofwtare development life-cycle.
